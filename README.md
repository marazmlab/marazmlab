## ü§ñ My Approach to AI-Assisted Learning

Throughout my learning process, I‚Äôve used AI tools (like ChatGPT) as a coding buddy and mentor‚Äînever to replace my own work, but to help me understand complex concepts, solve tricky bugs, and learn faster.

For me, AI is just the next step in a long tradition: developers have always used Stack Overflow, forums, or advice from teammates to move forward. AI is simply a new, interactive way to learn and problem-solve‚Äînothing more, nothing less.

I stay mindful of ethical and legal aspects, making sure my code is original and that I understand what I deliver. AI is a great assistant, but it‚Äôs up to me to do the thinking.
